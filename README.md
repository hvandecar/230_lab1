# WEB_230
Lab 1 and project 8 from WEB 230
This is lab 1 from my WEB 230 course (Advanced JavaScript) he gave us the HTML and the css. I wrote the JS to write the left nav ul when loaded. We are starting with the basics document.write().
Aswell as having the final project from the class to show my growth.
